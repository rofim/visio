## What is it?
The Vonage Video API Reference App for React is an open-source video conferencing reference application for the [Vonage Video API](https://developer.vonage.com/en/video/client-sdks/web/overview) using the React framework.

The Reference App demonstrates the best practices for integrating the [Vonage Video API](https://developer.vonage.com/en/video/client-sdks/web/overview) with your application for various use cases, from one-to-one and multi-participant video calling to recording, screen sharing, reactions, and more.

## Why use it?
The Vonage Video API Reference App for React provides developers an easy-to-setup way to get started with using our APIs with React.

The application is open-source, so you can not only get started quickly, but easily extend it with features needed for your use case. Any features already implemented in the Reference App use best practices for scalability and security.

As a commercial open-source project, you can also count on a solid information security architecture. While no packaged solution can guarantee absolute security, the transparency that comes with open-source software, combined with the proactive and responsive open-source community and vendors, provides significant advantages in addressing information security challenges compared to closed-source alternatives.

This application provides features for common conferencing use cases, such as:

- <details>
    <summary>A landing page for users to create and join meeting rooms.</summary>
    <img src="docs/assets/Welcome.png" alt="Screenshot of landing page">
  </details>
- <details>
    <summary>A waiting room for users to preview their audio and video device settings and set their name before entering a meeting room.</summary>
    <img src="docs/assets/WaitingRoom.png" alt="Screenshot of waiting room">
  </details>
- <details>
    <summary>A post-call page to navigate users to the landing page, re-enter the left room, and display archive(s), if any.</summary>
    <img src="docs/assets/Goodbye.png" alt="Screenshot of goodbye page">
  </details>

## Requirements


- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) (version 22)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
- optional - [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (recommended for switching Node versions)

## Running Locally

- **Ensure You Have a Vonage Account**

  You can create one at the [Vonage API Dashboard](https://dashboard.vonage.com/applications).

- **Create an Application in the Dashboard**

  Once logged in, navigate to the [Applications page](https://dashboard.vonage.com/applications) via the main dashboard menu:

  <details close>
  <summary>Applications dashboard view</summary>
  <img src="./docs/assets/readme/1-dashboard-applications.png" alt="Applications dashboard" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
  </details>

  If you don’t already have an application, create a new one:

  <details close>
  <summary>Create new app</summary>
  <img src="./docs/assets/readme/2-create-app.png" alt="Create app button" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
  </details>

  During the setup process, make sure to:

  - Provide a name for your application.
  - Generate and download the public and private keys.
  - Enable **Video** capabilities.

  Refer to the following image for visual guidance:

  <details close>
  <summary>Configuring a new app</summary>
  <img src="./docs/assets/readme/3-create-app-form.png" alt="Create app form" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
  </details>
  </br>

- **Environment Variables**

  In the root project directory, create the environment files by running:

  ``` bash
  cp backend/.env.example backend/.env && cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
  ```

  Then, open **backend/.env** and fill in the required configuration:

  - **VONAGE_APP_ID** – This is the ID of your Vonage application. You can find it on the [Applications page](https://dashboard.vonage.com/applications).
  - **VONAGE_PRIVATE_KEY** – If you've already generated a private key, use that. Otherwise, use the key you downloaded when creating the app.

</br>

-  **Start in Development Mode**

    ``` bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    This starts both the backend server (port **3345**) and the frontend Vite dev server (port **5173**). You can now access the app at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Storybook

Storybook is available for developing and testing UI components in isolation.

To run Storybook for the frontend:

```bash
yarn storybook:frontend
```

This will start the Storybook dev server at [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).

-----

To run Storybook for the ui:

```bash
yarn storybook:ui
```

This will start the Storybook dev server at [http://localhost:6007](http://localhost:6007).

## Testing on Multiple Devices

To test the video API across multiple devices on your local network, you can use **ngrok** to expose your frontend and backend publicly.

1. Create an account at [ngrok](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) if you haven't already.

2. Follow the [Setup and Installation instructions](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/) for your operating system to install and configure ngrok.

3. **Start the application locally first:**

    ``` bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    Make sure both the backend server (port 3345) and frontend dev server (port 5173) are running before proceeding to the next step.

4. Create secure tunnels for both frontend and backend:

    **Set up ngrok configuration:**
    
    First, find your ngrok config file location:
    ``` bash
    ngrok config check
    ```

    Create or edit the ngrok configuration file (typically located at `~/Library/Application Support/ngrok/ngrok.yml` on macOS; `~/.config/ngrok/ngrok.yml` on Linux and `%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Local\ngrok\ngrok.yml` on Windows) with the following content:

    ``` yaml
    version: "2"
    tunnels:
      frontend:
        addr: 5173
        proto: http
      backend:
        addr: 3345
        proto: http
    ```

    **Start both tunnels:**
    ``` bash
    ngrok start backend frontend
    ```

    This command will create publicly accessible HTTPS URLs for both your frontend and backend. The output will appear in your terminal, similar to the image below:

    <details close>
    <summary>ngrok output example</summary>
    <img src="./docs/assets/readme/4-forwarding.png" alt="ngrok tunnel example" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
    </details>

    </br>

5. Copy the domains from both outputs and update your **frontend/.env** file:

    ``` ini
    # Frontend tunnel domain
    TUNNEL_DOMAIN=your-frontend-domain.ngrok.io
    # Backend tunnel domain  
    API_URL=https://your-backend-domain.ngrok.io
    ```

    **Note:** ngrok assigns temporary domains. You'll need to update your environment variables each time the domains change.

  </br>

6. Open the provided frontend **Forwarding** URL in your browser. This exposes your entire application publicly, allowing devices on any network to access it.

</br>

Enjoy testing!

## Deployment to Vonage Cloud Runtime

You can deploy the application to Vonage Cloud Runtime (VCR) for testing in a cloud environment. See the [VCR overview](https://developer.vonage.com/en/vonage-cloud-runtime/overview) for more information.

For quick development deployments directly from your local machine, you can use the `vcr:dev` script:

1. **Install the VCR CLI** (if not already installed):
   
   Follow the installation instructions at https://developer.vonage.com/en/vonage-cloud-runtime/getting-started/working-locally#cli-installation

2. **Configure VCR with your credentials**:

   ```bash
   vcr configure
   ```

   Enter your Vonage API Key and Secret, and select a region.

3. **Generate application keys**:

   ```bash
   vcr app generate-keys --app-id <app-id> --region <region>
   ```

   Replace `<app-id>` with your Vonage application ID and `<region>` with your region.
   
   > ⚠️ **Warning**: You should use a **separate** Vonage application for VCR deployment (different from the `VONAGE_APP_ID` in your `backend/.env` file) to avoid issues with your private key.

4. **Set up your development configuration**:

   Copy the development configuration example file:

   ```bash
   cp vcr.yml.example vcr-dev.yml
   ```

   Open `vcr-dev.yml` and add your application ID.

5. **Deploy to development**:

   ```bash
   yarn vcr:dev
   ```

This will deploy using your local development configuration and code, making it quick to test changes in a cloud environment.

## Testing

### Integration Tests

We have integration tests using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). We recommend using their [VSCode integration](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode) to run tests.

To run the tests you need to run the app server separately:

```console
# In one terminal tab
yarn start

# In a separate tab. Or use vscode extension to run tests
yarn test:integration
```

#### Screenshot tests or Visual comparisons

We use [Playwright Visual Comparison](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-snapshots) for Screenshot UI tests. Since screenshot tests are part of our integration tests, running our integration tests also executes the screenshot tests.

#### Generating and Updating Screenshots

If we need to update the expected screenshot due to UI changes, we can delete the existing expected screenshot and then run the test. The test will fail, but a new expected screenshot will be generated. Running the test again should pass, as the expected and actual screenshots will now match.

For CI tests, we require screenshots for various browsers and operating systems because they [render interfaces with subtle differences](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/18240#issuecomment-1287546463).

To capture CI-specific screenshots, you can use the `update-screenshots` job. This job is triggered by creating a pull request (PR) with the `update-screenshots` label on GitHub. Once triggered, it will capture new screenshots on the virtual machine (VM) and automatically push those to the PR's branch.

### Running the backend and frontend test suites

- To run the frontend and backend tests:
```console
yarn test
```

### Backend Suite

- To run backend tests once:

```console
yarn test:backend
```

- For additional CLI options, see [jest docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/cli).

### Frontend Suite
We have frontend tests using [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro). We recommend using the [vitest VSCode integration]( https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vitest.explorer) to run tests.

For guidance on writing frontend unit tests, see the [Frontend Unit Testing Guide](./docs/TESTING.md).

Alternatively you can run the tests in the terminal:
- To run frontend tests once:

```console
yarn test:frontend
```

- For additional CLI options, see [vitest docs](https://vitest.dev/guide/cli#options)

## Code style

### Linting and auto-formatting
We use eslint and prettier to format code. Prettier issues will show up in eslint too via eslint-plugin-prettier.
You can setup an eslint extension for your editor. For VSCode use: [dbaeumer.vscode-eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).

You can either set up vscode to fix eslint issues on save or fix them with VSCode keyboard command palette shortcut `cmd + shift + p > "ESLint: Fix all auto-fixable problems"`.

In the terminal you can run

```console
yarn lint
```

to check for eslint issues and

```console
yarn lint:fix
```

to fix any auto-fixable issues and also run prettier on all files.

### File names

All filenames are in `camelCase`.

## Documentation Generation

We use `typedoc` to generate documentation from our jsdoc comments.
Generated documents can be found in the `frontend/dist` folder.

To generate documentation, run the following in the terminal

```console
yarn nx run frontend:docs
```
